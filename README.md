Splenda inspired by Splendee inspired by Splendor

Run sceneManager.py to play a game.

How to play the game ***********************

1.User must have pygame and Python installed to run the game

2.Open whole project by using 'open folder' from user's IDE to open folder 'Splenda' to import whole folder files 
  with corrected path for import class in the code.
  ('Open folder' is the name use in Visual studio code)

3.User can play the game by runing sceneManager.py in folder 'code'

*Note : - Project was created with "pygame 2.0.1", SDL 2.0.12 and Python 3.10.0
	- The game will only run correctly when user import folder 'Splenda' to IDE. 
	  The game will not run when user only run sceneManager.py without imported folder 
	  because path of file used in code is relative to folder 'Splenda' not the code
